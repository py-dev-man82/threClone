    # Extra Structures

    Structs defined here are not a mandatory part of any protocol but can be
    used with any of them.

# General crypto-related structs
crypto: &crypto
  encrypted-data-with-nonce-ahead:
    _doc: |-
      ## Crypto

      Contains encrypted data, prefixed with a 24 byte nonce.

      Note: This can be used for all ciphers using a 24 byte nonce, e.g.
      XSalsa20-Poly1305 and ChaCha20-Poly1305.
    fields:
      - _doc: |-
          Nonce used for encrypting the data.
        name: nonce
        type: *nonce
      - _doc: |-
          The encrypted data.
        name: data
        type: b*

# Monitoring structs

  _doc: |-
    ## Monitoring

    These structs can be used to monitor a network connection.
  rtt-measurement:
    _doc: |-
      Contains a timestamp for RTT measurement by reflection.
    fields:
      - _doc: |-
          A Unix-ish timestamp in milliseconds (for start reference).
        name: timestamp
        type: u64-le

# Transport structs
transport: &transport
  _doc: |-
    ## Transport

    These structs are helpful for network transports.
  frame:
    _doc: |-
      A fixed-length frame for stream-like transports.
    fields:
      - _doc: |-
          Length of the `data` field.
        name: length
        type: u32-le
      - _doc: |-
          The data.
        name: data
        type: b{length}
