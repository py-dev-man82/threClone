/**
 * A [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat.Callback] which will translate/move the given view during any
 * inset animations of the given inset type.
 *
 * This class works in tandem with [RootViewDeferringInsetsCallback] to support the deferring of
 * certain [WindowInsetsCompat.Type] values during a [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat], provided in
 * [deferredInsetTypes]. The values passed into this constructor should match those which
 * the [RootViewDeferringInsetsCallback] is created with.
 *
 * @param view the view to translate from it's start to end state
 * @param emojiPicker used to check for the special case of an opened emoji picker
 * @param persistentInsetTypes the bitmask of any inset types which were handled as part of the
 * layout
 * @param deferredInsetTypes the bitmask of insets types which should be deferred until after
 * any [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat]s have ended
 * @param dispatchMode The dispatch mode for this callback.
 * See [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat.Callback.getDispatchMode].
