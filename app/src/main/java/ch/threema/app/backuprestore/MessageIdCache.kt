/**
 * A cache for message ids as used in our database but can be retrieved by other infos (see MessageKey).
 * This is used when a data backup is restored, as we must not store database ids in a backup and must
 * therefore use another format for data that is related by the id.
 *
 * Note that this cache only retains a single entry. It is therefore only usable when the ids are
 * requested in a sorted manner (aka all entries referencing the same id are queried successively)
 * and must therefore not be computed over and over again.
