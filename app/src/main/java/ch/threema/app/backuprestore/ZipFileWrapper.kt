/**
 * The [ZipFile] class has the problem that whenever [ZipFile.getInputStream] is called, it keeps a reference to the created input stream internally.
 * This is essentially a memory-leak, as these references aren't needed for anything other than being able to close all streams when calling
 * [ZipFile.close], which in our case is unnecessary as we already close them pro-actively. The [ZipFileWrapper] class comes in as a
 * helper to this problem, by ensuring that [ZipFile.close] is called pro-actively as well, making it remove the unnecessary internal reference.
 * The [ZipFile] instance can still be used normally afterwards.
