Threema is the world’s best-selling secure messenger and keeps your data out of the hands of hackers, corporations, and governments. The service can be used completely anonymously. Threema is open source and offers every feature one would expect from a state-of-the-art instant messenger. The app also allows you to make end-to-end encrypted voice, video, and group calls. Using the desktop app and the web client, you can also use Threema from your desktop.

In contrast to the version distributed via Google Play, Threema Libre contains no proprietary libraries / components (like Google Play Services).

<strong>PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY</strong>

Threema is designed from the ground up to generate as little data on servers as possible. Group memberships and contact lists are managed on your device only and never stored on our servers. Messages are immediately deleted after they have been delivered. Local files are stored encrypted on your mobile phone or tablet. All this effectively prevents the collection and misuse of your personal information, including metadata. Threema is fully compliant with the European privacy legislation (GDPR).

<strong>ROCK-SOLID ENCRYPTION</strong>

Threema end-to-end encrypts all your communication, including messages, voice and video calls, group chats, files, and even status messages. Only the intended recipient, and nobody else, can read your messages. Threema uses the trusted open source NaCl cryptography library for encryption. The encryption keys are generated and safely stored on the users’ devices to prevent backdoor access or copies.
