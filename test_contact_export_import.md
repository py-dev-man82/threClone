# Contact Export/Import Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The contact import functionality had two main issues:

1. **Missing database persistence**: Contact changes were not being saved to the database
2. **Limited feedback**: Users weren't getting clear information about why imports were failing

## Root Cause Analysis
The `ContactExportImportService.updateContactFromJson()` method was modifying contact objects but not calling `contactService.save()` to persist the changes to the database. This meant that even when the import appeared to succeed, the changes were lost.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Database Persistence
- Added `contactService.save(contact)` call in `updateContactFromJson()` method
- Added change detection to only save when contacts are actually modified
- Added proper logging for successful updates

### 2. Improved User Feedback
- Enhanced error messages to explain that only existing contacts can be updated
- Added detailed feedback distinguishing between skipped contacts and actual errors
- Added explanatory message about security limitations

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added lists to track skipped contacts vs actual errors
- Improved result messages to be more informative
- Added null checks and validation

## Technical Details

### Key Changes in `ContactExportImportService.java`:
```java
// Before: Changes were not persisted
contact.setName(firstName, lastName);

// After: Changes are properly saved
if (wasModified) {
    contactService.save(contact);
    logger.info("Updated contact: " + contact.getIdentity());
}
```

### Security Design
The import functionality intentionally only updates existing contacts for security reasons:
- New contacts cannot be imported to prevent malicious contact injection
- Only safe metadata fields are updated (names, job titles, preferences)
- Identity and cryptographic information is never modified

## Expected Behavior Now

### Export
- Creates JSON file in Downloads folder with timestamp
- Exports all contact metadata including names, job titles, preferences

### Import  
- **Existing contacts**: Successfully updates names, job titles, read receipts, etc.
- **New contacts**: Skipped with clear explanation for security reasons
- **Errors**: Detailed error messages for file format issues

### User Feedback Examples
- Success: "Successfully imported 5 contacts"
- Partial: "Imported 3 of 7 contacts (4 failed) - Only existing contacts can be updated"
- Failure: "Failed to import contacts: Invalid file format"

## Testing Steps
1. Export contacts using the export menu option
2. Modify an existing contact's name
3. Import the exported file
4. Verify the contact name is restored to the exported value
5. Check that new contacts in the file are skipped with explanation
